This is a documentation of my project of a pedelboard with in a pedal or how to get all the air out of a Big Muff Pi.

It is a Fuzz with an active EQ, different selectable Fuzz versions, treble boost and a clean blend.

At first we searcht the web for all the fun ways to modify a Big Muff Pi to get as mutch veriaty as we can from our Muff.
For all the mods and more check out [Coda Effects](https://www.coda-effects.com/2015/11/big-muff-mods-and-tweaks.html?m=0), it was invalueable recource.

1) Clipping Stages (both stages!)
   - standard silicon diod
   - red LEDs
   - none

2) Tone Stack

   - To modify the tone stack of the Big Muff Pi I followed this video hier:

[![How To Modify Big Muff PI In Few Minutes Just For 1$ - DIY Tutorial by Occvlt Pedals](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z02aRTT1YLU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02aRTT1YLU)

   - and I wanted to be able to omit the tone stack completely. For that I used this instructions.

it is very nice from the people of StewMac, that they provide not only a video, but also an [instruction manual](https://www.stewmac.com/globalassets/video-and-ideas/online-resources/reference/stewmac-pedal-mod-kit-instructions/nyc-big-muff-tone-pi-stack-bypass-mod-kit-instructions).
