# The creation of the Franken Muff
  ### -- it's alive!!!!

This is a documentation of my project of a pedelboard with in a pedal or how to get all the air out of a Big Muff Pi.

The whole Project was inspired by the [KMA "Chief Disruptor"](https://kmamachines.com/machines/chief-disruptor/).

It is a Fuzz with an active EQ, different selectable Fuzz versions, treble boost and a clean blend.

## Modding the Big Muff Pi

At first we search the web for all the fun ways to modify a Big Muff Pi, to get as much veriety as we can from our Muff.
For all the mods and more check out [Coda Effects](https://www.coda-effects.com/2015/11/big-muff-mods-and-tweaks.html?m=0), it was an invaluable resource.
Another unbelievable resource is [The Big Muff Pi Page](https://www.bigmuffpage.com/Big_Muff_Pi_versions_schematics_part1.html) by Kit Rae. Here you can find out everything about the Big Muff and it's history.
And again Kit Rea to the rescue if you want to understand [what part does what](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_guts.html) within the Big Muff Circuit.

### 1) Clipping Stages (both stages!)
 - standard silicon diod
 - red LEDs
 - none

### 2) Tone Stack
 - To modify the tone stack of the Big Muff Pi I followed this video here:

[![How To Modify Big Muff PI In Few Minutes Just For 1$ - DIY Tutorial by Occvlt Pedals](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z02aRTT1YLU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z02aRTT1YLU)

 - and I wanted to be able to omit the tone stack completely. For that I used this instructions.

[![Big Muff Pi tone bypass - quick mod gets the midrange back by StewMac](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fCx0D6_93Xw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCx0D6_93Xw)

It is very nice from the people from StewMac, that they provide not only a video, but also an [instruction manual](https://www.stewmac.com/globalassets/video-and-ideas/online-resources/reference/stewmac-pedal-mod-kit-instructions/nyc-big-muff-tone-pi-stack-bypass-mod-kit-instructions). But be aware, that this manual is for a specific Big Muff version. You have likely a newer version, where the parts do not aligne with the parts in the manual or the video. It is, however possible to trace the tone stack, identify the corresponding parts of your Big Muff and apply the modification from the manual accordingly. Follow the [Kit Rea to the rescue link](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_guts.html) and you should be able to figure it out.

### 3. Capacitor on the Sustain potentiometer - clearer roll-off 
One of the easiest mods on the Big Muff, but in my oppinion one of the best is this one:

[![Schnelle und einfache Mods: Big Muff FUZZ by Tone Charme Audio](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-OzrYFc2938/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OzrYFc2938))

Yes it is the same guy from the tone stack mod, just on a nother youTube channel.

That's it, the Big Muff is all modded out.

I have heared you like guitar pedals. Time to put some more guitar pedals into your guitar pedals.

## Guitar Pedal Kits from [musikding.de](https://musikding.de/)

Musikding is my go to web shop for all DIY pedal building. So far I bought 6 kits and several other parts for project and I can highly recommend them. (Everything I have bought with my owne money and musikding.de has no knowledge about anything I'm writing here right now.

### 1) [Der Range - Germanium Treblebooster Bausatz](https://www.musikding.de/Der-Range-Germanium-Treblebooster-Bausatz)

For the range I just build the kit and addet it after the Big Muff. I decided to put it after the Big Muff based on a video I watched and now when I'm writing this I can't find it anymore. So you have to trust me, that out there on the interweb there is a video of a jung woman testing a rangmaster clone befor and after a fuzz and after sounded better. So based on this one video that is not anywhere to find and on my singel opinion and tast you should definiely alway and only play The Big Muff in front and never after a rangemaster clone of anykind. Otherwise the guitar gods will send you to hell for eternity and you will be condemed to repeate your 3 most heated chords for ever or something.     

### 2) [Clean Blend Master Bausatz](https://www.musikding.de/Clean-Blend-Master-Bausatz)

As of now, the Clean Blend Master is back in stock, but when I was building the project it was out of stock. It was however possible to order all the parts from musikding.de and order the pcb board from [PCB Mania](https://pcbguitarmania.com) seperately.
Now it's the other way around.

[PCB board for the Clean Blend Master](https://pcbguitarmania.com/product/clean-blend-master)

The Clean Blend Master is an add-on for other pedals. It usualy gets integrated into other pedals. I, however, wanted to keep it seperat with a send and return loop. So I wired an input jack on the input and an output jack on the output and a stereo jack with ... (I don't remember anymore), either the tip as send or the ring as return or the other way around. My Clean Blend is therefor seperat from the rest of the pedals. I brock out the trim pot, for the clean signal volume, so that I could adjust it on the fly.
However, after testing it I need actually a knob to reduce the the volume that I send to the other pedals. (Who would have thought? The other pedals have just 5 gain stages + EQ pedal which could also be another gain stage). That is why I used the potentiometer from the clean volume to reduce the volume of the signal that gets send to the pedals in the loop and soldered a jumper insted onto the socket of the clean volume trim pot so that it has always full volume.

So far everything seems very tame. We just soldered some kits together and chained inputs and outputs together.

Now it's time to put the Frank in Franken Muff. Muhahahahahahah

## Scalping and mutulating the JOYO 6-Band-EQ-Pedal

<a href="https://amzn.eu/d/3w9uaiD" target="blank"><img align="center" src="https://musicasatiendas.com/4118-medium_default/joyo-jf-11-equalizer-pedal-6-band-eq.jpg" height="250" /></a>

The big edvantages of the JOYO 6-Band-EQ-Pedal is:
1) it's size - it bearly fits with all the other pedals and footswitches
2) its color pellet, with black finish and red LEDs it fits well with the Big Muff color scheme
3) it's price - when I butcher that thing it shouldn't cost me an arm and a leg

Fiting everything into the enclosure was taxing. I first had to get the jacks off. I wanted to cut little slits for the faders into the Big Muff enclosure, however the sheetmetal from the Big Muff is so hard, it's a real hassel to cut and drill any shapes into it, let alone very straight parallel lines. I maneged to get three in which took for ages and in the prozess ruined the surface of the Big Muff. I needed a better solution. I would cut a big rectangle into the Big Muff to fitt all the faders and would close the hole of with the face of the Joyo. The aluminium was a blast to work with after the steal. Not only was I able to save the markings from the Joyo, so that one does know which frequenzes are changed by the equalizer, but when your pedal wares the face of another pedal, it schould look cool with agressive spiky teeth and little dead bead screw eyes. I also had to cut into the pcb of the Joyo to make space for Big Muff footswitch. It was where the former output jack resided. I was lucky that I didn't severed one of the copper lines within the pcb.

Originaly I wanted to be able to change the position of the equalizer either in front, or the back or insted of the tone stack into the Big Muff. However, I wasnt smart enough to figure out how to switch that. Now its stationary in the end of the chain.

Big Muff > Rangemaster > Joyo 6-Band EQ

The biggest question is how does it sound? I like the vintage blues sound one gets when the guitar volume knob is turned down. So the biggest win is the clarety rolling down the Sustain knob. I like the sound first stage silicone diode clipping, second stage LED clipping. In this setup I leaf the tone stack dead center, unmoded. Rangemaster and EQ not engaged. 

If you want the best sounding Big Muff I can produce with my setup, just do this two mods.

I'm still in search of a Muff that can beat the sound of my Franken Muff. I have tested the Wampler Crypted and the Wren and Cuff Your Face 60's and send them back.

If anyone wants to send me a contender. Get in touch and I will test them against my Franken Muff.

If you also want a Franken Muff with so many holes that you have to tare of faces from other pedals and make your Muff ware them as a totem mask. Be my guest and have fun with your Big Muff Pi.
